# rxtalk
Code demo for RxTalk first given at Brighton .NET user group in March 2015.

Includes three demo projects:

* Drag Drop in WPF
* Online Dictionary lookup triggered by a text box
* Detecting disconnects clients via a heartbeat.

The accompanying slides are at http://www.slideshare.net/james-world/a-brief-introduction-to-reactive-extensions

Note: Most of these examples were willfully plagiarised from slides and bits of demos done by the Rx-Team themselves, and repurposed to fit into a 20 minute datablast! Special thanks to the awesome Erik Meijer and Bart de Smet whose permission I didn't seek...
